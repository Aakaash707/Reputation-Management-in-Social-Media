Maggie is my favourite...but that new flavour MANCHURIAN MASALA is reallyyyyy realllyy horrible..i had high expections on that flavour before eating it but..it disappointed me.
Maggi is favourite to all of us. And that's Maggie masala is fantastic. But Maggie is very greedy it increased the price of its. But guys I love it very much that's why we should eat it
Meggi noodles are tasteless. No taste in masala. No taste in Maggi.
Maggie is the best product Till a year ago now it is the worst product found in the market
It has the worst taste what is this packing what are you thinking are you thinking of money??
"I think everyones love to eat maggie and I was also a maggie lover I used to eat lot of maggie but now I stopped because of the taste the old pack of maggie was far better from the new pack ,"
My experience is awesome you can buy without fear really awesome.I think iam eating maggie 6 months. I love the masala so tasty.
Please check Maggie very carefully before consuming it. Today I was preparing Maggie for my daughter for lunch box . While filling her tiffin I found many layers of Maggie are black in color in between as like hair in Maggie layer. So plz eat it carefully after seeing properly.
"We Must be provided with two packs of masala packet instead of one, Because one is not enough for meeee..."
My 5 year daughter faced severe rash on her face and body after consuming maggi masala variant. After few days i again tried cheese variety of Maggie to confirm whether the allergy was due to Maggie or not and my doubt was proved correct as soon as see consumed in some time she started scratching n felt uneasy and saw rash on her stomach. 
I have been eating Maggi since my childhood. Still I am not bored of Maggi. Reason is its Masala. The flavor and taste of the masala is something to die for.
It is a good food which can made up in 5 minutes . But sometimes their is lot of shortage of this product. When I go to buy this product in market it often not available and shopkeeper many other varities to me
Wonderful in taste . Quick snack ready in 2 min. Very easy for those in hostel we use to cook it often when food is not tasty. Midnight snackers will love maggi. Although health wise should not eat often but can consume once in a while. I love it with fried onions and garlic oil. Yummmmmy.
A snack of noodles that is everyone's favourite cuts out the odd time food cravings. Gets prepared in almost 2 mins. Very mych at affordable prices come in a pack of rs 5/- also. Its a kind of Atta noodles too much of anything is not good forhealth but lil intake of anything is good if maintained the diet properly so this Maggi comes in yellow packaging. Im a kind regular consumer when ever I get odd time hunger cravings maggi helps a lot to overcome the hunger nd makes me feel good. As ut can be prepared very fast with many different recipes. I usually mix a lots of veggies with it to make it healthier sometimes with fried onions it tastes grt. But with cheese it becomes delicious to consume.
As Maggy is the favorite fast food of everyone. I has been eating Maggy since my childhood and I don't want to take food I cook the Maggy and just enjoy ??.
"I love this product Maggi since I was a child. I love to eat Maggi noodles because of its delicious taste, it cooks up fast and easy to consume. Because of its great taste, Maggi is still in the market, that's why Maggi is my favorite noodles product."
Maggi is a good in taste I use maggi from the age of 4 . My dad also a wholesaler of nestle maggi
I m a big fan of 2min maggi from nestle. But currently maggie is not tasty at all. I always prefer to make maggie with the packet ingredients only. I don't use extra salt and Spices for making my maggie. But currently the maggie s masala flavour is not tasty at all.

"I often prepare Maggi noodle at home, it's just easy to cook and ready in just 2 minutes. Just take 2 Glass water in pan boil the water add the noodles and masala and cook for 2 minutes and your maggi is ready.It has nice aroma and flavor."
Maggi can be said as jung food which we get addicted in very less time. Maggi is low cost food easy to cook easy to handle and are available easily in the market. Instant maggi noodles are also available in the market. 
"As I am a fitness freak, so I am very carefull of what I put in my body.Maggi is unhealthy for many reasons."
"I tool yippee for some time but i did not faced any complications but since I took maggi noodles, it has severely affected my digestive system. I dont know what component is affecting me, but I sincerely think people should not get addicted. "
"My favourite food ever is maggi noodles , I don't know why some people jealous of maggi sucess, but the truth never goes down, I love the taste of maggi , I can eat it all day, maggi is very old product and safe for children "
Maggi noodles was a boon for a group of people who has not much time to spare for cooking and also they can eat tasty food.The masala makes the noodles very tasty.Most children nowdays like to have it all the times.
It is best snack at the time of emergencies. They it is a 2 Min noodles but I would say it is more like a 5 Min noodles.
It is very easy to make Maggi Noodles and when we cook it with green vegetables then it becomes much more deliceous and healthy.
Excessive Consumption of Maggi Noodles results in high cholesterol levels and causes cancer.It is delicious and yummy food but not good for health.

Veg atta noodles masala got changed and I Am not liking it so please make it simple as it was earlier please remove garlic and ginger from masala not liking it but loved the earlier flavor. Please consider this as request and implement it thank you.
It takes to much time to digest. Company of Maggie is pretension that the Maggie is make in 2 minutes but it's not totally true.
Maggi masala is so tasty.and I eat so many times only masala.
"I stopped eating Maggi noodles because it was found unhealthy and was banned in india for some time, it was found that some chemicals in Maggi are really not good for health."
Crunchy test and full mix of water and without used pot cooking. Only boil water used and cuppa noodles is ready to serve. And it is best before eight month and this is enough
"What problem is, it is not good for digestive system because of its lead content and its transfat content because it is not fried in vegetable oil it is fried in vanspathi"
But a breathtaking incident occurred that is it had a higher lead content which was harmful for health. Later it was banned in india because it had higher levels of lead content which was higher than the permissable levels.
I have eaten this product that is maggi noodles and it is one of my favourite among all the other noodles in the market.
Maggi is a best brand of noodles and pasta. It is very easy to cook no other ingredients need to cook it. I always eat maggi in the evening because I have a little time to cook so I only prefer noodles my nephew also easy maggi even he take it in his tiffin box. 
Maggi Noodles is one of the most popular noodles brand and also its taste is also good but due to some cicumstances people think it is injurious to health but it is not true because no one dies by eating this
I tell you maggie noodles is not good for health.its easy to cook that's why some people cooked maggie noodles.i cooked maggie noodles many time but when I eat maggie noodles I feel like vomiting and I can't eat more
"Doctor told me if a person eat Maggi Noodles continuously the they can suffer from Hypertension, Diabetes, High cholesterol Obesity etc. It also increase fats in our body. Then I started to avoid Maggi Noodles from my sister. So friends I think Maggi Noodles specially effect no Children health. Try to avoid it as mush as possible. That's my opinion."
I thought maggi is healthy and for that reason only I used to eat maggi for once in 3 days but my family doctor told me about side effects of maggi.
I really love maggi. Because I love the taste and aroma of the maggi. Nothing is better then maggi for me. The taste of maggi is super cool. I just want to taste the spicy maggi. But till now I am in love with maggi. The colour and packaging of maggi is so attractive.
When it was banned in market due to some reasons of Quality. Some fan of Maggi were getting disappointed. But goodness is that it comes again and grab the position and reputation again.
It is because the news released by food research department that it contains the materials as preservatives which were used in the gun powder and it was totally unfair treatment of love of people for Maggie and after that I gave up eating noodles and u should too give it up.
As soon as I think to eat noodle I definately choose maggi as it is best in taste and its flavour is amazing.maggi is one of the best noodles ever anfmd also its flavours are not matched by any othet noodles.
The maggie Noodles is the gateway of diseases in our body. There is a pack of spices in the maggi Noodles pack. We didn't know that how much this is old. 
I have eat maggi daily for breakfast and whenever I feeling hungry. Maggi is comes with very testy and Yummy Flavor.
"Maggi Noodles which is the most tasteless noodles ever eaten by me. Am eating this noodles from my childhood and thought that these are the original and last noodles,"
If we talk about its flavour which is geniunly amazing and  delicious in taste . All of the ingredients are blended so finely that its small packet of masala contain almost all of ingeridents with fine characterization.
"Maggi noodles are most love noodles by every generation of people. Especially by the younger generation. There are so many brands available in the market for the noodles but still, people go for Maggi noodles."
Maggie is my most loved noodle there are such a large number of new brands in the market however Maggie's masala is so one of a kind and more delicious than some other brand.
Before some months this maggi noodles suffers goes from Doubtful situations and there was many kinds of fake news goes viral for close this noodles product. and researchers done many kinds of research maggi noodles but no issue is found in Maggi and again Maggi cames in market with it's delicious flover and test.
The flavours are so perfectly blended. That in each bite the flavour come so nicely. The packaging of the product is also good it comes in a Yellow packet. Which is very much appealing.
I adore the enchantment masala enhance ita my most loved and the new hot heads enhance they presented is wgat I require I'm a significant other of anything zesty and hot heads grill enhance is the best.
The bundling has been the same throughout the years yet the yellow parcel is so engaging and appealing . The cost is presently raised 5rs parcel is littler now however that won't make it less more delicious .
"After a controversy about using harmful ingredients,  it is now tottaly safe and no harmful ingredients are used now."
The taken by it to be processed is the lowest in case of foods that are processed in fire.  So it helps mothers in preparing a delicious food in no time
"At present this moment, Going to past approx 15 years ago, First time I saw the maggie and after eated I feel very well, because it taste too good and its masala are very attractive to people's tounge that""s why peoples love the maggie, but but but, its not good for our health because its one of the junk type of fast food"
We are all deserve for good quality.Maggi is not so good for our health
"i like its taste and during my college time, I used to get up late so I cooked maggi and my hunger ended.it has been a part of my life."
Even if your mummy is not there to help you you can cook it by yourself with few easy steps and it will be cooked in just 2 minutes. The taste is so amazing.
Approx 2 years ago it had banned by the FSSAI and reason behind was that it did not meet the required quality which is set by FSSAI. But after some months maggi came back with a maintained standard of quality and liked by its lovers same as before due to its yummy and amazing taste which could not be beaten by any noodles.
"Maggi is a good quality product.and its taste is verry delicious.it has many flavours . like.chicken, chili. Etc."
but on one time the maggi market was over due to using something which is very harmful to our health but what happens again it runs in a indian market.maggi noodles is very good in taste but you eat maggi noodles you will fill a sleep
According to me maggi is not good for health so please dont eat it.
"it causes restless sleep every single time. The next time you can't sleep well, think about if you've had some instant noodles."
Maggi noodles is not good food for human health. This is normal flavour and normal testy noodles.
This price is high and quality is low. I abandoned to using Maggi Noodles. 
Maggi is the most popular fast food now. It is ready in just five minuites. It is a very delicious tiffin for every child. Every mother chooses maggi for tiffin. 
Due to ban on Maggi there are lots of other noodle company launch the noodles and promote it as it is more healthier then that of Maggi. But Maggi again comes to the market and by failing the other brands again dominating in a Noodles category.
Good treat for taste buds. 
The masala taste is very unique although a lot of flavours are available in maggi. It has passed all the tests if health and hygene.
"It is very good tasty noddles till now I eat it I am eating it from childhood, It can be made within 5 mins and it is very good in taste and flavour is also good"
If you are looking for the best noodles than maggies is the one you should buy.
"Noodles are made with maida which is not good for health.maggi does not contains any fibre, protein vitamins in the noodles."
